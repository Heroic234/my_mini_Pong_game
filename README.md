# My_mini_Pong_game

I began this project  recently and I am still working on major improvements with friends and family to bring game development to all in the near future

Special thanks to friends and family who tested out the game and gave useful feedback

Your contributions will not go wasted


My_mini_Pong_game consists of three files
 
 Two of which are .ogg for in game sound and a .py file which contains the code for the pong game
 
 In the bid to add extra features, I have not yet converted the game to an executable file
 
 However interested individuals can still play the game by following these simple guide lines
 
 >>Click on the code section in the repository for this game and select download zip
 
 >>Once downloaded extract the files and open the folder with Vscode
 
 >...To install Vscode.. type vscode install in your windows browser and download the desired version
 



>...Download the python programming Language from www.python.org *version >=3.7

>..Then finally install pygame

>..To install pygame first open the windows command prompt and type 

>>pip install pygame


Setup info for python in Vscode can be found online
