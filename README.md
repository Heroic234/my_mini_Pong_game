# My_mini_Pong_game

I began this project  recently and still working on major improvement with friends and family to break game development to all in the near future

Special thanks to friends and family tested out the game and game me feedback

Your contributions will not go wasted


My_mini_Pong_game consists of three files
 
 Two of which are .ogg for in game sound and a .py file which contains the code for the pong game
 
 In the bid to add extra features, I have not yet converted the game to an executable file
 
 However interested individual can still play
